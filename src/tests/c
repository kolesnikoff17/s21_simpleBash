A decimal numeral (also often just decimal or, less correctly, decimal number), 
refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system.

 Decimals may sometimes be identified by a decimal separator 
 (usually "." or "," as in 25.9703 or 3,1415).
[4] Decimal may also refer specifically 
to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in "3.14 is 
the approximation of to two decimals". 

Zero-digits after a decimal separator serve the purpose of signifying the 
precision of a value.
