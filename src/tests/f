Maine was able to put the infractions in the past the next season and got off to a fantastic start. With Allison acting like a wall in the crease, Maine didn't lose until its 20th game and went on to tie for the league lead. 
Allison set a program record by winning 32 games and played in 51 consecutive matches when all was said and done. He was named as a first team All-American and helped 
the Black Bears return to the NCAA tournament. Maine received a bye into the quarterfinal round and won their opening match against 6th-seeded Denver. In the Frozen Four, they had to face the 
top 
 

western seed, Michigan. The two produced one of the most memorable games in NCAA history, slugging it out for over 100 minutes of playing time. 
Allison made 47 saves in the triple-overtime classic and allowed Dan Shermerhorn to score the winning goal in what was then the longest game in NCAA tournament history.[3] Allison felt his 
team was fortunate to survive the game but they did advance to the championship game for a showdown against rival BU. Allison played well in the final game but penalties cost Maine early as BU built a 3-0 lead 
in the first 30 minutes. The Black Bears were able to close the gap to within 1 early in the third period 

 but were only able to capitalize on one of eight man-advantages while BU went three for four on the power play and closed out the game with the last three goals.[4] Despite the sour end, Allison was named as the top goaltender of the tournament.
